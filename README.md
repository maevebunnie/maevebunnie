`about me`
BASIC INFO !
what's up, call me Maeve or Maliko.
i have Dissociative Identity Disorder,
and i'm a fictive of Midari Ikishima from Kakegurui. 

i use she/bun/doll/ichor/pink/vamp pronouns. yes, i do use these pronouns seriously!
i also identify with xenogenders. (genders that aren't girl/boy! they're outside of the girl/boy gender binary and fall under the 'non-binary' category. i'd suggest doing research on these before dismissing it as "mocking" or "offensive"!)
 if you're against this, remember that gender is a construct and that humans themselves invented it and pronouns; pronouns are just another way to refer to a person besides their name! they are just words!!  so, i can identify as whatever gender i'd like and use whatever pronouns i like. if you disagree with that, i'm sorry for you; have a lovely day :) 

please don't interact if:
;you like daganronpa, split, homestuck, dsmp, kakegurui
[you're just weird, sorry!]

;you support or are: an endogenic "system", multi-spec lesbian/gay, you support kink at pride parades, if you self-identify as an "IRL/DA" (you're just reality checking YOURSELF...)
[you're a gross person!<3]

;if you're a fictionkin anyone from of my source, if you role-play as anyone from my source, if you expect me to be friends with you JUST because of us being sourcemates, if you sexualize my source-self
[just because you make me uncomfortable!]
